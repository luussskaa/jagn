# jagn

jagn ("Just a Gloryfied Notepad") is a pretty self-explanatory React + Tauri application.

It's the middle way between the usual boring and ugly notepad apps and a basic text editor.

With jagn all the important formatting is done automatically, so your notes will look fancier than never.

You can also add structure to your notes, adding titles and subtitles while all the margins, font-sizes and text alingments are done behind the scenes.

More than creating, viewing, editing and deleting notes, yagn also lets you print them or turn them into a pdf file as well.
