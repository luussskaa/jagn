# jagn

jagn ("Just a Gloryfied Notepad") is a pretty self-explanatory React + Tauri application.

It's the middle way between the usual boring and ugly notepad apps and a basic text editor.

With jagn all the important formatting is done automatically for you, so your notes will look fancier than never.

You can also add structure to your notes, adding titles and subtitles while all the margins, font-sizes and text alingments are done for you.

More than creating, viewing, editing and deleting notes, you can print them or turn them into a pdf file as well.
